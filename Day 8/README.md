# 📝 React To-Do List App

A simple **To-Do List application** built using **React**.  
This project is designed for **beginners** who have just started learning React but want to see how to split code into multiple components and manage state in a clean way.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Clear completed tasks
- Shows how many tasks are left
- Data is saved in **localStorage** (persists after refresh)

## 📌 Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

Check if they are installed:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Create a New React Project

```bash
npx create-react-app my-todo-app
cd my-todo-app
```

### 2️⃣ Replace the Files

Inside the `src` folder:

* Replace the default `App.js` and `index.js` with the ones provided in this repo.
* Create a `components` folder inside `src` and add:

  * `TodoForm.js`
  * `TodoList.js`
  * `TodoFooter.js`

*(I have only provided the files where I have written code. Other files and folders are auto-generated by Create React App.)*

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

Since Create React App already sets up React for you, no extra dependencies are required. Just install the defaults:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 📖 How It Works

* **App.js** → main component, holds the state for all todos.
* **TodoForm.js** → form for adding new tasks.
* **TodoList.js** → displays the list of tasks and allows toggling completion.
* **TodoFooter.js** → shows task count and a button to clear completed tasks.
* **localStorage** → saves todos so they stay after refreshing the page.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Process (Step by Step)

1. Started by creating a new React app with Create React App.
2. Planned the app into 3 smaller components: `TodoForm`, `TodoList`, `TodoFooter`.
3. Implemented `useState` to manage todos and input text.
4. Used `useEffect` to sync todos with localStorage.
5. Added simple inline CSS styles inside each file (easy for beginners to follow).
6. Split code into separate files for better readability.

## 📌 Note

👉 I have only provided the files where I have performed the coding.
Other files and folders (`public/`, `node_modules/`, config files, etc.) are auto-generated when you create a React project using `create-react-app`.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project is a beginner-friendly way to learn:

* React components
* Props
* State management with `useState`
* Side effects with `useEffect`
* Local storage for persistence
