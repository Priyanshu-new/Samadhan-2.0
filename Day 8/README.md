## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project from scratch:

### 1. Create a new React project using **Create React App**

```bash
npx create-react-app my-todo-app
cd my-todo-app
```

### 2. Clean up the project

Remove the default files inside the `src` folder (like `App.css`, `logo.svg`, etc.).

### 3. Add the required files

Inside the `src` folder, create the following structure:

```
src/
├── App.js
├── index.js
└── components/
    ├── TodoForm.js
    ├── TodoList.js
    └── TodoFooter.js
```

Now paste the provided code into each file.

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

Your app will open automatically in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
my-todo-app/
└── src/
    ├── App.js
    ├── index.js
    └── components/
        ├── TodoForm.js
        ├── TodoList.js
        └── TodoFooter.js
```

* **App.js** → Main component (manages state & logic)
* **TodoForm.js** → Input field + Add button
* **TodoList.js** → Displays the list of tasks
* **TodoFooter.js** → Shows remaining tasks + clear button

---

## 🎯 Features

* ➕ Add new tasks
* ✅ Mark tasks as completed
* 🗑️ Clear completed tasks
* 💾 Saves tasks in **Local Storage** (persists after refresh)

---

## 📌 Note

I have only provided the files where I actually wrote code (`App.js`, `index.js`, and `components/*`).
Other files and folders are **autogenerated** by Create React App.

Would you like me to also add **screenshots or demo GIF section** in the README so it looks more appealing for GitHub?
