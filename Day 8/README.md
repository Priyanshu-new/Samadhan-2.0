### 1️⃣ Create a new React project

We will use **Create React App**:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-todo-app
cd my-todo-app
```

This command automatically creates a new folder `my-todo-app` with all the necessary files and folders.

---

### 2️⃣ Project Structure

After running the command, your project will look like this:

```
my-todo-app/
├── node_modules/          # 📂 Auto-generated dependencies (do not edit)
├── public/                # 📂 Public static files
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
├── src/                   # 📂 Main source code folder
│   ├── App.css            # Auto-generated styles (not used in this project)
│   ├── App.js             # ✅ Our main code file (modified)
│   ├── App.test.js        # Auto-generated test file
│   ├── index.css          # Auto-generated global styles
│   ├── index.js           # ✅ Our main entry file (modified)
│   ├── logo.svg           # Auto-generated logo (not used)
│   ├── reportWebVitals.js # Auto-generated performance file
│   ├── setupTests.js      # Auto-generated test setup
│   └── components/        # ✅ We created this folder
│       ├── TodoForm.js    # ✅ Our custom code
│       ├── TodoList.js    # ✅ Our custom code
│       └── TodoFooter.js  # ✅ Our custom code
├── .gitignore             # Auto-generated
├── package.json           # Auto-generated (project dependencies)
├── README.md              # You are reading this file 🙂
└── yarn.lock / package-lock.json
```

✅ I have **only provided the files where I performed coding** (`App.js`, `index.js`, and the `components` folder).
The rest of the files and folders were **autogenerated by Create React App**.

---

### 4️⃣ Run the project

In the project folder, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the app in your browser at:
👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🎮 Usage

* Type a task in the input box and click **Add**.
* Tick the checkbox to mark a task as completed.
* Click **Clear Completed** to remove all completed tasks.
* The counter shows how many tasks are left.
* Refresh the page, and your tasks will still be there (thanks to local storage).

---

## 📂 Files I Worked On

These are the files where I wrote code:

* `src/index.js`
* `src/App.js`
* `src/components/TodoForm.js`
* `src/components/TodoList.js`
* `src/components/TodoFooter.js`

⚠️ **Note:** All other files and folders (like `node_modules`, `public`, `App.css`, `logo.svg`, etc.) were **autogenerated** when I created the React app.
I have not modified those files.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

* This project is intentionally **kept simple** for beginners.
* You can add more features later (edit tasks, filters, themes, etc.).
* I have only provided the files where I wrote the code.
* All other files/folders are **default autogenerated files** from Create React App.
