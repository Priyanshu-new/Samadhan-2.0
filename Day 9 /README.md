# 📘 Student Directory (React + Node.js)

A simple full-stack web application that displays a **Student Directory**.
The backend is built with **Node.js + Express**, and the frontend is built with **React**.
The frontend fetches student data from the backend API using **Fetch API** and **useEffect**.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
* A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 🛠️ Project Setup

This project is divided into **two parts**:

1. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
2. **Frontend (React)**

---

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

1. Create a new folder and initialize a Node.js project:

   ```bash
   mkdir student-directory-backend
   cd student-directory-backend
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install express cors
   ```

3. Create a file named `server.js` and add the backend logic (provided in this repo).

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The backend will run at:
   👉 `http://localhost:5000/api/students`

---

### 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

1. Create a React project:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app student-directory-frontend
   cd student-directory-frontend
   ```

2. Navigate into the `src` folder and update the necessary files (`App.js` and `App.css`) as provided in this repo.

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will run at:
   👉 `http://localhost:3000`

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Start the **backend** server:

   ```bash
   cd student-directory-backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. Start the **frontend** React app:

   ```bash
   cd student-directory-frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and visit:
   👉 `http://localhost:3000`

You will see the **Student Directory** fetching data from the backend API.

## 📝 Notes

* This project demonstrates the usage of **useEffect** and **Fetch API** in React with a **Node.js backend**.
* I have only provided the files where I personally performed the coding (`server.js`, `App.js`, and `App.css`).
* Other files and folders are **autogenerated** by tools such as **npm** and **Create React App**, and they are part of the project structure.
