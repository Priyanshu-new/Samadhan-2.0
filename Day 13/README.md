# 📝 Notes App — Full Stack (Node.js + Express + MongoDB + HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a simple yet fully functional **Notes App** built with a Node.js and Express backend, MongoDB for data persistence, and a clean HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

The app allows users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete (CRUD)** notes from a friendly interface. All notes are stored in a local MongoDB database.

> ✅ This project has been structured and coded professionally. Only files where actual development was performed have been included here. All auto-generated files and folders will be present once setup is complete (see below for details).

## 🚀 Features

- Add new notes with a title and content
- View all saved notes
- Edit existing notes
- Delete notes
- Responsive and minimal UI
- RESTful API backend with MongoDB

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine before getting started:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (from Scratch)

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Notes App locally on your system:

### 1. Clone or Create the Project Folder

```bash
mkdir notes-app-project
cd notes-app-project
````

### 2. Create the Frontend Folder

```bash
mkdir public
```

### 3. Create the Required Files

In the root folder (`notes-app-project`), create a file named:

* `server.js`

Inside the `public` folder, create:

* `index.html`

> Only these two files are needed to start the app. These are the files I have directly coded in this project.

### 4. Initialize the Node Project

```bash
npm init -y
```

This will generate a file called `package.json` automatically.

### 5. Install Dependencies

Install the required backend packages:

```bash
npm install express mongoose
```

This command will generate a folder called `node_modules` and update `package-lock.json` automatically.

### 6. Run MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is installed and running locally.

* If using default settings, MongoDB runs at: `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`

You can start MongoDB with:

```bash
mongod
```

> No extra configuration is required if you're using the default setup.

### 7. Start the Server

From the root project directory:

```bash
node server.js
```

Once the server is running, you’ll see:

```
Server is running! Check it out at http://localhost:3000
Database connection successful!
```

---

## 🌐 Access the App

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You will see the Notes App UI ready to use!

## 📁 Auto-generated Files and Folders

Here’s a list of files/folders that will be automatically created or updated during setup and runtime:

| File/Folder         | Description                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `package.json`      | Project metadata and dependencies                     |
| `package-lock.json` | Automatically generated for exact dependency versions |
| `node_modules/`     | All installed Node.js dependencies                    |

> ⚠️ These files are system-managed and not manually coded.

## 📌 Final Notes

* This project has been kept minimal and clean on purpose.
* Code is well-structured, clearly commented, and suitable for beginners and intermediate developers alike.
* Only the **actual coded files** (`server.js` and `index.html`) have been provided manually.
* All **other files/folders** are either generated automatically or managed by the system.
