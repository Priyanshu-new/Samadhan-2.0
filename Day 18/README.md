# 📝 Mini TaskBoard

A simplified, Trello-like project management tool built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It is designed to be clean, minimal, and educational — ideal for understanding the basics of DOM manipulation and project structuring.

---

## 📌 Features

- Create multiple **boards**
- Add **lists** inside each board
- Add **cards** inside each list
- Simple UI with responsive design
- Beginner-friendly code style (easy to follow and extend)

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A computer with any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- A text editor (VS Code recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed (optional, for cloning the repo)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-new/mini-taskboard.git
cd mini-taskboard
````

> If you don’t want to use Git, you can also download the repository as a `.zip` file and extract it.

---

### 2. Project Structure

After extracting/cloning, you’ll see the following structure:

```
mini-taskboard/
│
├── index.html       # Main HTML file (coded by me)
├── styles.css       # Styling file (coded by me)
├── script.js        # Core JavaScript logic (coded by me)
│
├── .git/            # Auto-generated Git folder (if cloned via git)
├── README.md        # Project documentation (this file)
```

✅ **Note**: I have only provided the files where I performed the coding (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`).
Other files and folders like `.git/` are auto-generated by Git or IDEs. They are not manually edited.

---

### 3. Open the Project

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser:

* On Windows: Double-click the `index.html` file
* On macOS/Linux: Right-click and select **Open With → Browser**

No server setup is required since this is a pure **frontend project**.

## 🛠️ Development Process (Step by Step)

This project was developed from scratch in small steps, similar to how a student in India might approach it:

1. **Setup basic HTML file**

   * Added project title and a button to create new boards.
   * Created placeholders (`div` containers) for boards and lists.

2. **Styling with CSS**

   * Added simple but clean styling for boards, lists, and cards.
   * Used colors inspired by Trello for familiarity.
   * Ensured responsiveness using flexible widths and padding.

3. **JavaScript logic**

   * Created arrays to store boards, lists, and cards.
   * Added functionality to create boards (`prompt` for board names).
   * Inside each board, allowed adding lists.
   * Inside each list, allowed adding cards.
   * Used DOM templates (`<template>`) for dynamically rendering elements.

4. **Final polish**

   * Added hover effects and simple card/list styling.
   * Structured code with meaningful comments for easy understanding.
   * Verified the project works properly in multiple browsers.

## 📂 Files Explained

* **`index.html`** → Structure of the app, templates for boards/lists/cards, and root containers.
* **`styles.css`** → Layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
* **`script.js`** → Handles all the logic (creating boards, lists, cards, rendering dynamically).

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

1. Open the project in your browser.
2. Click **"+ Add Board"** to create a new board.
3. Inside a board, click **"+ Add List"** to create a list (e.g., *To Do*, *In Progress*).
4. Inside a list, click **"+ Add Card"** to add tasks.
5. Keep organizing your workflow!

---

## 🧑‍💻 Future Improvements

* Add drag-and-drop functionality for cards.
* Save boards/lists/cards in `localStorage` for persistence.
* Add due dates, labels, and team members.
* Create a more polished modal system instead of using `prompt()`.

---

## ✅ Final Note

This project is intentionally kept **beginner-friendly** and reflects the thought process of a student learning step by step.
The code is clean, minimal, and can be easily extended into a more advanced project.
