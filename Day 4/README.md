Day 4: API retuning "Hello World"

First, we made the computer understand the most basic things, like **on and off** signals.

Then, we created simple **codes and commands** to give the computer instructions, instead of using just on and off signals.

Next, we made the whole process easier by inventing **programming languages** like JavaScript. These let us write code that's almost like plain English. But we still needed a "translator" to turn our English-like code into the computer's language.

That's where **Node.js** comes in. It's the translator. We created it to handle all the complicated, behind-the-scenes work, like connecting to the internet and managing files.

So, when you type `node app.js`, you're not doing the hard work of connecting wires or speaking in code. You're just asking Node.js to do all that for you, using the code you wrote in plain English.
