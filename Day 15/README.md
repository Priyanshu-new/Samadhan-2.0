# 🔐 React Authentication App

A simple, clean, and professional login-based authentication app built with React. This project demonstrates how to structure a front-end authentication flow using functional components and mock login logic, with a responsive and modern UI powered by Tailwind CSS.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This app simulates a basic login experience where users enter credentials to access a protected dashboard. No real backend is connected — a temporary **Mock API** simulates API behavior. The purpose of this app is to demonstrate proper separation of concerns, functional state management, UI control, and basic protected route logic.

> ⚠️ Note: I have only included and provided the files where actual coding has been done in a clean, modular, and professional way. All other files and folders are assumed to be autogenerated by the tooling during setup (like Vite).

## 📦 Features

- React functional components with clean state handling  
- Mock API integration simulating real-world login  
- Tailwind CSS styling via CDN  
- Component-based file separation for reusability  
- Responsive UI with minimal design  
- Error handling and loading state during login  
- Clean logout and reset state mechanism

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- React (via Vite)  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)  
- Axios (optional – for future API connectivity)  
- JavaScript  
- No real backend (uses temporary Mock API due to less time )

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or above)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### 1. Creat the file

```bash
cd react-auth-app
````

### 2. Initialize the project using Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Choose the following options:

* **Project name**: `react-auth-app`
* **Framework**: `React`
* **Variant**: `JavaScript`

This will scaffold the project folder with the required files.

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
cd react-auth-app
npm install
```

### 4. Add Tailwind CSS CDN (skip full Tailwind config)

Open `index.html` and insert the Tailwind CDN link in the `<head>` section:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

No further Tailwind configuration is necessary.

### 5. Add your custom component files

Inside the `src` folder, create the following structure:

```
src/
├── api/
│   └── MockApi.js
├── components/
│   ├── Dashboard.jsx
│   └── LoginForm.jsx
├── App.jsx
└── main.jsx
```

Each of these files contains the actual implementation logic and UI code for the app.

> Again, only these files contain the hand-written logic for the app. All other files in the Vite project (e.g., `index.html`, `.gitignore`, `vite.config.js`, etc.) are autogenerated and untouched.

| `src/components/LoginForm.jsx` | Login form component with validation and loading state         |
| `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` | Protected dashboard displayed after login                      |
| `src/App.jsx`                  | Root component managing auth state and routing logic           |
| `src/main.jsx`                 | React entry point and Tailwind setup script                    |
| `public/index.html`            | Contains the root element and CDN imports                      |
| `node_modules/`                | Autogenerated after running `npm install`                      |
| `package.json`                 | Project metadata and scripts (autogenerated)                   |

## ▶️ Running the App

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Use these test credentials to login:

* **Username:** `student`
* **Password:** `davegray`

---

## 🧪 Testing Behavior

* Enter incorrect credentials → You’ll get an error message.
* Enter correct credentials → You’ll be redirected to the dashboard.
* Click logout → You’ll return to the login screen with state reset.

---

## 📌 Final Notes

* The project uses a **temporary mock API** (`MockApi.js`) in place of a real backend due to limited development time.
* This placeholder makes it easy to switch over to a real API later by simply replacing the `MockApi.js` logic.
* Only manually-created files are included in this repo. All other files such as `node_modules`, build scripts, Vite setup files, and `.gitignore` are considered default tooling-generated content.
* The app is structured in a way that any developer reading this can **fully understand the project flow and rebuild it from scratch** without confusion.

---

## 📤 Deployment (Optional)

You can deploy this app easily using:

* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (with small config changes)
