Day one project 
    target := Print student details from an object
    
    
    Divide into 3 Parts

HTML (the skeleton 🦴) → structure of the webpage.

CSS (the clothes 👕) → makes the page look nice.

JavaScript (the brain 🧠) → makes things happen when we click.

Build HTML

Made a heading <h1> to show “Student Details”.

Made a <button> so user can click.

Made an empty <div> box where details will appear.

Add CSS

Gave colors (blue heading, green button, gray background).

Made the button round and clickable.

Styled the student details text.

Write JavaScript

Created an object called student (like a backpack with details inside).

Made a function showStudent() to put details inside the <div>.

Linked it to the button → when clicked, it runs the function.

Connect Everything

Linked CSS file in <head> → for styling.

Linked JS file at bottom of <body> → for logic.

Tested in browser → button works, details show. 🎉
