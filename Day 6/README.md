# Profiles – React Project

A simple **React + Vite** project that displays team member profile cards with images, names, job titles, and short bios.
This project is structured in a clean and modular way to help beginners understand how to separate logic and styling in React projects.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (v18 or later recommended)
* **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js) or **yarn**
* A **code editor** like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Git (optional, if you want to clone the repo directly)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Create a new React project with Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest team-profiles -- --template react
```

### 2. Navigate into the project

```bash
cd team-profiles
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Replace/Add Project Files

Inside the `src/` folder, update/add the following files:

```
src/
 ├─ App.jsx
 ├─ ProfileCard.jsx
 ├─ App.css
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
team-profiles/
 ├─ node_modules/
 ├─ public/
 ├─ src/
 │   ├─ App.jsx
 │   ├─ ProfileCard.jsx
 │   ├─ App.css
 │   └─ main.jsx
 ├─ package.json
 ├─ vite.config.js
 └─ README.md
```

* **App.jsx** → The main entry component that renders the page and loads profile data.
* **ProfileCard.jsx** → A reusable card component for displaying profile information.
* **App.css** → Contains all styling for the project.
* **main.jsx** → Entry point of the app (autogenerated by Vite).

## ▶️ Running the Project

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start, and you can view it in your browser at:

👉 [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## ✨ Features

* ⚡ Built with **React + Vite** (fast dev environment)
* 🎨 Modern UI with responsive card design
* 📦 Clean separation of **JSX (logic)** and **CSS (styles)**
* 🌗 Light and dark mode–friendly styles (via Tailwind-like design system)
* 🔥 Beginner-friendly, minimal boilerplate

---

## 📖 Learning Goals

This project demonstrates:

* Creating React components (`App.jsx`, `ProfileCard.jsx`)
* Passing props to child components
* Styling with a separate CSS file
* Setting up and running a Vite-based React app

---

## 📝 Note

I have **only provided the files where I have worked and written code**.
Other files and folders (like `node_modules`, `vite.config.js`, `main.jsx`) are **autogenerated** by Vite and do not require manual changes.

Would you like me to also **add screenshots/demo preview section** in the README so it looks even more polished for a portfolio?
