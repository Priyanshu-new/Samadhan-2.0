## ðŸ“– About The Project
This application offers a seamless and intuitive user experience for checking the weather. Users can type the name of any city and instantly receive:  
- Current temperature  
- Weather conditions  
- Date and time  

A key **visual feature** is the **dynamic background**, which adapts to the temperatureâ€”showing warmer tones for hot days and cooler tones for cold days.  

This project demonstrates practical use of **React concepts**, including:  
- Component-based architecture  
- State management with Hooks (`useState`)  
- API requests handling  
- Conditional rendering & styling
