## 📖 About The Project
This application offers a seamless and intuitive user experience for checking the weather. Users can type the name of any city and instantly receive:  
- Current temperature  
- Weather conditions  
- Date and time  

A key **visual feature** is the **dynamic background**, which adapts to the temperature—showing warmer tones for hot days and cooler tones for cold days.  

This project demonstrates practical use of **React concepts**, including:  
- Component-based architecture  
- State management with Hooks (`useState`)  
- API requests handling  
- Conditional rendering & styling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- [Node.js (with npm)](https://nodejs.org/)  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  

### ⚡ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-weather-app.git


2. **Navigate into the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd react-weather-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up API credentials**

   * Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and get a free API key.
   * Inside the `src/` folder, create a new file called `api.js`.
   * Add the following code:

     ```javascript
     export const api = {
       key: "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY",
       base: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/"
     };
     ```

   ⚠️ *For production environments, store API keys in environment variables for security.*

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will run on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 📝 File Development Note

The **custom implementation** resides mainly in:

* `src/App.js` → Core React component, state handling, API logic, JSX.
* `src/App.css` & `src/index.css` → Custom styling and layout.
* `src/assets/` → Background images for dynamic theming.

All other files are part of the default **create-react-app** setup.

## 🎯 Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Enter a city name in the search bar (e.g., *London*, *Tokyo*).
3. Press **Enter**.
4. View real-time weather data with dynamic backgrounds.
