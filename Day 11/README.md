## ðŸš€ Student CRUD API

This project is a simple, beginner-friendly RESTful API for managing student data. It demonstrates the four core **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. The API allows you to perform operations on a student database through dedicated endpoints.

-----

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

  * **Node.js**: [Download and Install](https://nodejs.org/)
  * **MongoDB**: [Download and Install](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
  * **npm** (Node Package Manager): Comes with Node.js.

### Project Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd student-crud-api
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`, including `express` and `mongoose`.

3.  **Start MongoDB**
    Make sure your MongoDB server is running. You can start it from your command line if you have it installed locally.

4.  **Run the Server**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start and listen for requests on port 3000. You will see the message "Server Started" and "Connected to Database" in your terminal.

### Files and Folders

This project is organized into three main files and two folders, as well as several autogenerated files that you'll see after setup.

#### **Project Structure**

```
student-crud-api/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ student.js          # Mongoose schema for the Student data model
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ students.js         # Defines all the API endpoints for students
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js               # The main server file that connects to the database and starts the API
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore              # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Lists project metadata and dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json       # Records the exact version of each installed package
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/           # Folder containing all installed packages
```

  * **`models/student.js`**: This file defines the `Student` data structure using Mongoose. It specifies the fields for a student, such as `name`, `rollNumber`, and `major`.
  * **`routes/students.js`**: This file contains all the Express route handlers for the API. It defines how the server responds to different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) at the `/students` endpoint.
  * **`server.js`**: This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, connects to the MongoDB database, and links the student routes to the main application.
  * **Autogenerated files**: After running `npm install`, the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file are automatically generated. These are essential for managing project dependencies and should not be manually edited. The `.gitignore` file is also a standard part of a Node.js project to prevent unnecessary files from being tracked by Git.

### API Endpoints

This API provides the following endpoints for managing student data. You can test these endpoints using a tool like Postman or `cURL`. The base URL for the API is `http://localhost:3000/students`.

#### **1. Get All Students**

  * **Method:** `GET`
  * **URL:** `/students`
  * **Description:** Retrieves a list of all students.
  * **Example `cURL`:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/students
    ```

#### **2. Get a Single Student**

  * **Method:** `GET`
  * **URL:** `/students/:id`
  * **Description:** Retrieves a single student by their unique ID.
  * **Example `cURL`:**
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/students/64b54e26a640994f31c2a11b
    ```

#### **3. Create a New Student**

  * **Method:** `POST`
  * **URL:** `/students`
  * **Description:** Adds a new student to the database.
  * **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "rollNumber": "101",
      "major": "Computer Science"
    }
    ```
  * **Example `cURL`:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"Jane Doe\", \"rollNumber\":\"102\", \"major\":\"Electrical Engineering\"}" http://localhost:3000/students
    ```

#### **4. Update a Student**

  * **Method:** `PATCH`
  * **URL:** `/students/:id`
  * **Description:** Updates an existing student's information. You can update one or more fields.
  * **Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "major": "Data Science"
    }
    ```
  * **Example `cURL`:**
    ```bash
    curl -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"major\":\"Data Science\"}" http://localhost:3000/students/64b54e26a640994f31c2a11b
    ```

#### **5. Delete a Student**

  * **Method:** `DELETE`
  * **URL:** `/students/:id`
  * **Description:** Deletes a student from the database.
  * **Example `cURL`:**
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/students/64b54e26a640994f31c2a11b
    ```
