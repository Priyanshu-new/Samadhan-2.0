# Styled Product Card List (Tailwind CSS)

This project is a **Styled Product Card List** built with **Tailwind CSS**.  
It demonstrates how to create a responsive, modern UI component using utility-first styling.  
The cards are responsive, animated on hover, and styled in a clean, professional way.

## ⚙️ Setup Process (From Scratch)

### 1. Create a new project folder
```bash
mkdir styled-product-cards
cd styled-product-cards
````

### 2. Initialize npm

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 3. Install Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
```

### 4. Configure Tailwind

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### 5. Add Tailwind Directives

Create `src/input.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 6. Create the HTML File

Add an `index.html` in the root folder.
This file contains the styled product card list.

### 7. Build CSS

Run Tailwind to generate CSS:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch
```

This will create `dist/style.css` automatically.

### 8. Open in Browser

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the styled product card list.

## 🗂️ Autogenerated Files and Folders

* `dist/style.css` → Generated by Tailwind from `src/input.css`
* `node_modules/` → Installed automatically by npm to store dependencies
* `package-lock.json` → Auto-generated lockfile that records dependency versions

---

## 📌 Notes

* I have only provided the files where I performed the coding in a **very professional way**.
* Other files and folders such as `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and the compiled `dist/style.css` are **autogenerated**.
* This project is final and ready to run as explained above.
