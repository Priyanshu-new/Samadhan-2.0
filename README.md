## 🎓 Special Mention – AI in Special Education
We also worked on a **research-based project and presentation (PPT uploaded in this repo)** titled:  
**“AI in Special Education for Differently Abled Students”**  

- Problem: Over **1 billion people** live with some form of disability, yet most education platforms lack accessibility.  
- Solution: An **AI-powered platform** with features like Sign Language Translation, Text-to-Speech, Eye & Facial Input, and Audio Study Materials.  
- Tech Stack: **React, Node.js, MongoDB, TensorFlow, Google Cloud APIs**  
- Goal: **Accessible learning is not optional – it’s essential.**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🌟 Inspiration – Priyanjali Gupta
We are inspired by **Priyanjali Gupta**, an engineering student at **Vellore Institute of Technology, Tamil Nadu, India**, who developed an **AI model that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into English in real time**.  

- Built using **TensorFlow Object Detection API** + **SSD MobileNet model**  
- Recognizes ASL signs like *Hello, Thank you, Yes, No* via webcam  
- Plans to extend with **LSTM for sequence-based recognition**  
- Her work gained **58K+ LinkedIn likes**, showcasing the impact of inclusive technology  

Her journey motivates us to work towards **bridging communication gaps** and building **accessible solutions for differently abled people**.

## ⚡ Important Notes
- All **README.md files are AI-assisted** (we are beginners on GitHub and used AI to structure documentation).  
- Some coding **errors were debugged with AI support**, but the **logic and mini task solutions were written by our team members**.  
- We sometimes **shared GitHub credentials** to push code since we are new to collaboration.  
- Some snippets may **look AI-generated**, but all **ideas and final implementations were developed by us**.
