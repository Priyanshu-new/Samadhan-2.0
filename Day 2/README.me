Day 2 : Find highest marks from an array\

We started with HTML (the skeleton ðŸ¦´):

We made a page with a title, a button, and a place to show the answer.

This is like building the frame of a house before painting or decorating.

Then we added CSS (the clothes ðŸŽ¨):

We gave the page colors, fonts, and button styles.

This is like decorating the house to make it pretty and friendly.

Finally, we wrote JavaScript (the brain ðŸ§ ):

We created an array of marks (numbers).

We made a function to find the biggest number in the array.

We used a loop to check each number, one by one, and remembered the biggest one.

We connected this function to the button â†’ so when the button is pressed, the result shows on the screen.
