Day 3 : Simple Student Marks Calculator

We thought of the idea →
“I want to make something that takes marks of 3 subjects and tells me the total, average, and grade.”

We built the skeleton (HTML) →
Just like building a house frame.

We made text boxes (input) where users can type marks.

A button (button) that we can click.

An empty space (p) to show the result.

We gave it clothes (CSS) →
To make it look nice.

Changed background color.

Made the button pretty.

Made the result text bigger.

We gave it a brain (JavaScript) →
To do the real work.

Collected numbers typed in the boxes.

Added them for total.

Divided by 3 for average.

Used conditions (if ... else) to decide grade.

Finally, told the page to show the result.

We connected all parts →

HTML (skeleton) + CSS (clothes) + JS (brain).

Now the project can talk to the user: you type marks, it gives you answers.
